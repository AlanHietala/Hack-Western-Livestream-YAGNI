# Hack Western Livestream - YAGNI

Livestream of building an app up with minimal dependencies showing that the idea of You Ain't Gonna Need It (YAGNI) often means you spend time working on the things that really matter during a hackathon. 

This app built out a little demo of being able to search and save favourites from the Starwars API https://swapi.dev using only 3 dependencies and VanillaJS. 

During the livestream I only added things when I really needed them. 

The dependenices added were express, Axios to simplify http requests in node, and nodemon to reload my app on file save. 

Things I didn't need were a frontend framework, or a database. The rough idea was working in under 2 hours with < 120 lines of code.
